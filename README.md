# Design:   

I started with a wireframe on paper with pencil as shown below:  

![Wireframe Design](assets/screenshots/wireframe_design.jpg)  


**Text & Background colour:**

 I selected both the text and background colours suitable for a magical world for witches and wizards. I wanted to keep the colour palette a bit mysterious and include images related to magic. I have used a lighter shade for the header and the footer to provide some contrast from the main sections.

# Game Rules 

The quiz has total 20 questions. Each question has 4 options out of which one will be the correct answer. There is a timer of 15 seconds to answer each question before moving onto the next. For each correct answer, you'll get 10 points. At the end, the final score is displayed.
 If you score above 170, you are an expert witch or wizard.
If the score is between 70 and 170, you need to practice your spells.
If you score less than 70, you better learn your spells before you need them!
