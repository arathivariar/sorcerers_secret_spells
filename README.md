# Sorcerer’s Secret Spells

# Quiz On Magical Spells

Sorcerer’s Secret Spells is an online quiz on the magical spells used by witches and wizards for making magical things happen. This is the perfect game for all the Potterheads (Harry Potter fans) out there who believe in the magical world and its charms.

# Design:   

I started with a wireframe on paper with pencil as shown below:

**Text & Background colour:**

 I selected both the text and background colours suitable for a magical world for witches and wizards. I wanted to keep the colour palette a bit mysterious and include images related to magic. I have used a lighter shade for the header and the footer to provide some contrast from the main sections.
